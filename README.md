This is a simple framework that uses https://openweathermap.org/ to demo how to test apis. 
There will be no real authentication using api because this is just a demo.

to run the test and see the report, run these commands:
1) git clone https://github.com/zfharb/onfleet_api.git
2) gradle
3) gradle clean build allureReport
4) gradle build allureServe
